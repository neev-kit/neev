# Acknowledgments

Neev stands on the shoulders of giants. We're grateful to the projects and people that inspired and informed its design.

## Projects & Inspiration

### Spec-Kit
**GitHub**: [github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)  
**Authors**: GitHub  
**Contribution**: Pioneering spec-driven development methodology and GitHub Copilot slash commands integration approach.

Spec-Kit demonstrated that specs and code should be kept in sync, and that AI tools could be integrated natively into developer workflows. Neev builds on these principles while adding cross-project support, automated documentation generation, and alignment verification.

### OpenSpec
**GitHub**: [Fission-AI/openspec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/openspec)  
**Authors**: Fission-AI  
**Contribution**: Change tracking, AI-assisted development patterns, and migration tooling concepts.

OpenSpec showed how to make specs central to the development process and track changes over time. Neev incorporates these ideas into its inspection and alignment verification features.

## Core Principles

These projects informed Neev's core philosophy:

1. **Specs first** - Architecture should be documented before implementation
2. **AI-native** - Tools should integrate seamlessly with modern development environments
3. **Source of truth** - Specifications should be the single source of truth for architecture
4. **Automation** - Drift detection, documentation generation, and testing should be automated
5. **Developer experience** - Specs should be easy to write and maintain, not burdensome

## Technical Inspiration

- **Go community** — Language design, conventions, and standard library patterns
- **Open-source ecosystem** — Best practices in testing, documentation, and community management
- **Specification formats** — OpenAPI, YAML, Markdown standards and conventions
